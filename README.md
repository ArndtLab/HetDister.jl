Module to run demographic inference on diploid genomes, under the assumption of panmixia (i.e. the inferred effective population size is half the inverse of the observed mean coalescence rate).
See the docs and [this](https://github.com/ArndtLab/DemoInferDemo) repo for a demo of how to use it.
The method is published at ...

You can have a look at the companion package [DemoPlots.jl](https://github.com/ArndtLab/DemoPlots.jl) for plotting utilities.
