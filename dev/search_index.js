Heterozygous positions are the ones with genotype 0/1 or 1/0 (Note that the phase is not important). The input is then a vector containind such distances. Additionally, mutation and recombination rates need to be chosen and passed as input as well. See Tutorial for more details on preparing input data.\n\nThe demographic model underlying the inference is composed of a variable number of epochs and the population size is constant along each epoch.\n\nThe output is a vector of parameters in the form [L, N0, T1, N1, T2, N2, ...] where L is the total sequence length, N0 is the ancestral population size in the furthermost epoch and extending to the infinite past, the subsequent pairs (T_i N_i) are the duration and size of following epochs going from past to present. This format is referred to as TN vector throughout. The length L should match the input sequence length and is floating to improve the fit.\n\n","category":"section"},{"location":"#HetDister.FitOptions-Tuple{Any, Any, Any}","page":"Home","title":"HetDister.FitOptions","text":"FitOptions(Ltot, mu, rho; kwargs...)\n\nConstruct an an object of type FitOptions, requiring  total genome length Ltot in base pairs, mutation rate and recombination rate per base pair per generation.\n\nOptional Arguments\n\nTlow::Number=10, Tupp::Number=1e7: The lower and upper bounds for the duration of epochs.\nNlow::Number=10, Nupp::Number=1e8: The lower and upper bounds for the population sizes.\nlevel::Float64=0.95: The confidence level for the confidence intervals on the parameters estimates.\nsolver: The solver to use for the optimization, default is LBFGS().\nsmallest_segment::Int=1: The smallest segment size present in the histogram to consider  for the signal search.\nforce::Bool=true: if true try to fit further epochs even when no signal is found.\nmaxnts::Int=10: The maximum number of new time splits to consider when adding a new epoch.
